plus:  # performs integer addition
# Requirement:
# - you cannot use add* instruction

minus: # performs integer subtraction
# Requirement:
# - you cannot use sub* instruction

mul: # performs integer multiplication - when both operands are non-negative!
# You can assume that both operands are non-negative.
# Requirements:
# - you cannot use imul* instruction 
#   (or any kind of instruction that multiplies such as mul)
# - you must use a loop
